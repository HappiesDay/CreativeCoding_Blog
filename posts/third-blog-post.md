## What is cute as an catergory?
Cute is easy to understand since it is very intuitively easy to acknowledge via its look, its sensory feeling, or its lack of other quality. It can be defined as the spare time for empathy via its vulnerability and commodity.<br>
Firstly, vision serves as a primary sense, as we, as humans, are hard-wired to assess potential threats swiftly. If an entity does not pose imminent danger, then we are to judge it as weird or cute depending on if we are able to attach human-like qualities to it. For example, a lion tripped and fell into the water video would be cute if it stays a video. We can empathize with the lion since we are not there with the lion. Similarly, if it lacks a self-defense mechanism and approachability is available, a power dynamic is formed. <br>
Baby-like, disproportionally small, defenseless, or completed ownership give us a quality of being superior. The urge to buy, to possess and to get close is a commodity aesthetic (Ngai 2020). For example, Hello Kitty is very popular due to its pink pastel and innocent appeal that also makes it a widely sold and lovable product. Accessibility is important for power dynamics. This also tightly intertwined with consumer culture. We want to get close to it first, fixate our curiosity and violently consume it. On one side we like it enough to protect it and on the other side, we are hypnotized to do so willingly.<br>
 "Cute" aesthetic, it often makes us feel a special way, sparking emotions like warmth and love. But how we react to cuteness can be influenced by our culture and society. Sometimes, what's considered cute can bring out tender feelings, and other times, it might lead us to view things in a less serious, more playful light. While art does not always share all the cute definitions, art comes from a place of narrative or abstract, making it qualifies for empathy and vulnerability, and expression, the quality of touchable.

## Effective Complexity?

Effective Complexity explores the structural balance between making sense and unpredictable variety. Too much would represent chaos and too little would be rigid rules. In cute aesthetic, it is about simplicity and complexity dwell within. Take the example of the mouse Jerry from Tom and Jerry animated series. Jerry has a simple, adorable design, big eyes. However, his expressive facial reactions opens up the complicated naughty personality inside which adds depth to initial fa√ßade innocence outlook. A cute look reinforced by a contrasting behavior pushes the sweet spot of making sense of what we're seeing, but also enough unpredictability or variety to keep things interesting.

### Third idea: Add a way to create more square for every square on the horizon line

# Response to Only Suddenly
## Make the border for the circle
First to make the frame which was quite easy since you only need four rectangle position correctly

## Add velocity to a ball in the middle
Simply change the ball X and Y position to make it move
<br>
More X means moving to the right
<br>
More Y means moving to the bottom
<br>
The hard part is to calculate the ball position for it to collide with the box. 
I was very confuse on why the ball keep going outside of the border until I realise the Y count from top to bottom, not from bottom to top like how a graph would. The higher the Y the lower the position. When I realise this, calculating the collision line was rather easy.
When collide, to make the ball goes the opposite way, change the ball X from positive to negative will make the ball left -> right become ball right -> left, vice versa with ball Y
