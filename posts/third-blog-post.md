Hello, world


# AT1 concept
## What is cute as an catergory?
Cute is easy to understand since it is very intuitively easy to acknowledge via its look, its sensory feeling, or its lack of other quality. It can be defined as the spare time for empathy via its vulnerability and commodity.
Firstly, vision serves as a primary sense, as we, as humans, are hard-wired to assess potential threats swiftly. If an entity does not pose imminent danger, then we are to judge it as weird or cute depending on if we are able to attach human-like qualities to it. For example, a lion tripped and fell into the water video would be cute if it stays a video. We can empathize with the lion since we are not there with the lion. Similarly, if it lacks a self-defense mechanism and approachability is available, a power dynamic is formed. 
Baby-like, disproportionally small, defenseless, or completed ownership give us a quality of being superior. The urge to buy, to possess and to get close is a commodity aesthetic (Ngai 2020). For example, Hello Kitty is very popular due to its pink pastel and innocent appeal that also makes it a widely sold and lovable product. Accessibility is important for power dynamics. We want to get close to it first, fixate our curiosity and violently destroy it. On one side we like it enough to protect it and on the other side, we are hypnotized to do so willingly. While art does not always share all the cute definitions, art comes from a place of narrative or abstract, making it qualifies for empathy and vulnerability, and expression, the quality of touchable.

## Second idea: Change the size of square

<br>

### Third idea: Add a way to create more square for every square on the horizon line

## Make the border for the circle
First to make the frame which was quite easy since you only need four rectangle position correctly

## Add velocity to a ball in the middle
Simply change the ball X and Y position to make it move
<br>
More X means moving to the right
<br>
More Y means moving to the bottom
<br>
The hard part is to calculate the ball position for it to collide with the box. 
I was very confuse on why the ball keep going outside of the border until I realise the Y count from top to bottom, not from bottom to top like how a graph would. The higher the Y the lower the position. When I realise this, calculating the collision line was rather easy.
When collide, to make the ball goes the opposite way, change the ball X from positive to negative will make the ball left -> right become ball right -> left, vice versa with ball Y
