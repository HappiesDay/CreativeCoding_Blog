Hello, world

## I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS by Lauren Lee McCarthy.
1. Be an example of mycelial creativity?
I think the project follows all 4 of the attribute of the Mycelial Creativity. The context of this project establishment falls in the Covid, and the project aims to warn everyone in the globe. It disregard the geometrical and cultural bounderies because everyone could fall sick to the virus. It's omnidirectional is clear for it's context. And for every interaction someone could make with this project, the project message becames clearer and adds to the overall depth which makes it accumulative in nature. We could feedback upon it aswell. And ironically, to participate on the project requires interaction, but not using your voice. In Covid time, not talking is something very new and it changed our perception and understanding on how we can safely interact. It also use the material rejected by other systems which is subtitle which is very rare in our day to day interaction. Finally, after interacting, we reflects upon ourself on when talking can be dangerous and we learn to keep word to ourself unless neccessary. This message can translate further than just the Covid virus time, and we learn that talking can damage other people feeling and just health. 

2. Belong to the aesthetic category of interesting?
The project has provoke discussion, and interesting does have an informational and discursive aesthetic to it. Pre-Covid, we never think of talking is an action of harm. Post-Covid, wearing mask and talk less when sick is the norm. Perception of new information or unexpected ideas is very crucial in making something interesting. In a way, making the project provide with new insight: talking is dangerous yet slightly lack something could also brings in discussion on how we can collectively improve it. Overall the project is very strange yet simple in nature, therefore making it very alluring and interesting.

3. Brainstorm
The my Community of Practice (CoP), I have a main Cop I want to contribute to using my creative coding: Sound design. However there is one niche that I really want to fill: A better way to show how we percieve the sound. I have struggle with coming up idea for sound design, and drawing is a fun and great way to express my idea.
My domain should be: Intersensory designer (Or me and DnD besties who are looking for a way to better describe a sound so we could make the setting more immersive)
The shared value: I focus mainly on aesthetic quality where describing an accuarate auditory experience for my sensory designer friend is fitting and evocative for the context in which we will later use for our DnD campaign .
Existing repertoire: Audio-Visual Synchronization (For example Youtube music video), Subtitle in movies (Audio to visual), VR,...
How I might broker some creative coding repertoire to this new context: For my intention, I only intend on collaborative aspect of the project where I want to make a drawing app so the other can react real time on what my interpretation of the sound is.
