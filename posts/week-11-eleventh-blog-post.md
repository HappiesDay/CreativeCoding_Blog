Hello, world

## In what ways might the practice of creative coding attend to problems regarding digital infrastructure? 


As our world evolves, we're seeing more products that seem to overlap in function and purpose. SO make something unique, we require deep technical skills and a very niche problem. This field often brings people together to collaborate, drawing on knowledge from different areas to create something new and culturally relevant. Creative coding is an example of this trend where the practice are collaborative, digital literacy and effortlessly communication or readibility. 
However, the field of creative coding is still largely unregulated, making it vulnerable to exploitation. As we become more entrenched in digital life, niche problems become more bizzare, yet the data we produce often ends up in the hands of major companies that gatekeep these knowledge and even patent the way to produce something. This however indicate a direction on open source knowledge and co development where more open-source collaboration and shared development come together to push back against these restrictive practices and encourage a freer exchange of ideas.
