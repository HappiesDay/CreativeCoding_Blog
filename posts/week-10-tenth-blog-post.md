Hello, world

## Reflection 
1. What aspects of the process were frustrating?
One aspect of the process that I really hate is how much back and forth I have to go back to the reference sheet for which code generate which notes. It is not very user friendly and intuitive to perform. Also the constant high pitch note is very sensory overloading and I hate being exposed to sound like that for extended amount of time. Another not as frustrating but more on the suprise is when my friends add their notes and it make my intention derailed which was funny.


2. What aspects of the process were rewarding,
Being collaborative yet left suprise on what my friend gonna do is very interesting and is very fun. It is also very rewarding to ruin their intention by adding weird stuff.

3. What are the live-coding community trying to do? Why?
I think it is a very innovative way to perform art. Art usually requires time to refine and develop. By making it on the fly, it force a different skillset to collab smoothly. By combining the classic visual and audio but in a real-time way, it can foster new reaction, new way to collab. It is lower-ceiling which can entice newer people who are not familiar with either visual, audio, performance to try out and maybe develop a liking for this art.
